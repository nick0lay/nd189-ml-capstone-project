    "Investment firms, hedge funds and even individuals have been using financial models to better understand market behavior and make profitable investments and trades. A wealth of information is available in the form of historical stock prices and company performance data, suitable for machine learning algorithms to process. Accurate prediction of stock market returns is a very challenging task due to volatile and non-linear nature of the financial stock markets. Since a lot of investors use AI models to work with stocks it's become very important to predict price for making decisison about future investment or porfolio rebalancing. For those who use Reinforcement Learning it's also quite important since agent should know when to hold or sell/buy new assets to expect better reword for the action in future.\n",

    "Academic research prove that stock closing price can be predicted with ML algoritm. According to this research prediction is quite accurate for some stocks. Please check links of this research below. Even though that alogorithms poove to be working we still should keep in mind, that they are undable to predict future and sometime unexpected events might happend. For example natural disasters, issuew in supply chain, etc. can lead to stock price go down unexpectedly. Hence it's good to use different sources to take a good decision, because ML algorithm in most cases can find patterns in stock behavior rather than predict real stock price. \n",

    "Build stock price predictor which will use historical data to predict stock price for given date. It's quite clear for me that it's impossible to predict future sock movement, becouse it depends on a lot of different factors. For example:\n",

Hence the main goal of this project try to build predictor which try to find patterns in the past stock movement and help with decision making process together with some other information.\n",
    " \n",
    "Ideally there should be a lot of such type of predictors whic use different types of informations, for example market news or satellite images, etc. Which combined in ensamble model for better prediction, but this require a lot of time and efforts to be developed. Hence in this project we try to reduce scope and build small part of bigger system and did small research if it worth to make this type of predictions at all."

According to different researches such ML architectures as RNN and Transformers perform better than for example Random Forest (XGBoost).

For this type of porject Transformers will be used since RNN networks has some following issues comparing to Transformers architectures.\n",
